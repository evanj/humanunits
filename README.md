# Rust Human Units

Converts units to human readable strings. You probably should use [ubyte](https://crates.io/crates/ubyte), [humansize](https://crates.io/crates/humansize), or [human_bytes](https://crates.io/crates/human_bytes) instead. I created this while playing around, and wanted to reuse it across a couple of my own projects, so I published it. I don't publish it to crates.io because it probably should not be reused.
